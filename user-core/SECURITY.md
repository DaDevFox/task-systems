# Security Considerations for User-Core

## Current State (v0) - Minimal Authentication

For v0, User-Core operates with minimal authentication to reduce integration complexity for existing services:

- No password-based authentication
- No JWT tokens or session management  
- Users identified by ID only
- Basic validation of user existence

This approach minimizes code changes required in:
- Tasker-Core (already has user management)
- Home-Manager (basic user tracking)
- Inventory-Core (future integration)

## Future Security Enhancements (v1+)

### Authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with configurable expiration
- **OAuth Integration**: Support for Google, GitHub, Microsoft providers
- **API Keys**: For service-to-service authentication
- **Refresh Tokens**: Secure token rotation

### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin, User, Guest roles
- **Resource Permissions**: Fine-grained access control
- **Service-Level Permissions**: Different access levels per service

### Data Security
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt or Argon2 for credential storage
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive user data encryption at rest
- **TLS**: Encrypted communication between services
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization

### Audit and Monitoring
- **Audit Logs**: Track all user management operations
- **Failed Login Tracking**: Detect brute force attempts
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of authentication endpoints
- **Security Events**: Integration with monitoring systems

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy User-Core with minimal auth alongside existing services
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate services to use User-Core for user validation
3. **Phase 3**: Add JWT authentication with backward compatibility
4. **Phase 4**: Full RBAC implementation
5. **Phase 5**: Deprecate local user management in other services

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks (v0)
- **Low Risk**: Internal services only, no external exposure
- **User Impersonation**: Any service can act as any user ID
- **No Access Control**: All users have equal privileges

### Mitigation (v1+)
- Service authentication via API keys
- User authentication via JWT tokens
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Input validation and rate limiting

## Configuration Security

User-Core will manage sensitive configuration:
- Notification service credentials (email, SMS)
- External API keys (Calendar, etc.)
- Service integration tokens

Secrets should be:
- Encrypted at rest
- Rotatable via API
- Audited on access
- Environment-specific
