# Task Core Service - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete backend service for task management with Go, gRPC, and Protocol Buffers. The system manages tasks through defined lifecycle stages with dependency tracking and extensible architecture.

## Implementation Completed ✅

### 1. Core Architecture
- **Domain Layer**: Task models with business logic validation
- **Repository Layer**: In-memory implementation with interface for future database integration
- **Service Layer**: Business logic orchestration and workflow management
- **gRPC Layer**: Protocol buffer-based API with type-safe communication
- **CLI Tools**: Server and client applications for testing and interaction

### 2. Task Lifecycle Management
- **Stage 0 (Pending)**: New tasks from users/automated triggers
- **Stage 1 (Inbox)**: Limited capacity stage (configurable, default: 5)
- **Stage 2 (Staging)**: Tasks with dependencies, locations, and points
- **Stage 3 (Active)**: Currently executing tasks with time tracking
- **Archived**: Completed tasks (removed from active system)

### 3. Core Features Implemented
- ✅ Task creation with unique short IDs (8-character hex)
- ✅ Stage transitions with validation rules
- ✅ Dependency management (inflows/outflows)
- ✅ Point-based work tracking with completion detection
- ✅ Hierarchical location tagging
- ✅ Status history and updates with timestamps
- ✅ Inbox capacity constraints
- ✅ Chain hopping prevention
- ✅ Task merging within same dependency chain
- ✅ Task splitting with dependency inheritance
- ✅ Task advertising (1→N dependencies)
- ✅ Task stitching (N→1 dependencies)

### 4. API Endpoints
All endpoints implemented with proper error handling and validation:

- `AddTask`: Create new task (→ pending)
- `MoveToStaging`: Move task to staging with location/points
- `StartTask`: Begin work (staging → active)
- `StopTask`: Pause work with partial completion
- `CompleteTask`: Mark fully complete (→ archived)
- `MergeTasks`: Combine tasks in same chain
- `SplitTask`: Split into multiple tasks
- `AdvertiseTask`: Create 1→many dependencies
- `StitchTasks`: Create many→1 dependencies
- `ListTasks`: Filter by stage
- `GetTask`: Retrieve by ID

### 5. Testing Coverage
Comprehensive test suites implemented using table-driven tests:

- **Domain Tests**: 11 test functions covering all business logic
- **Repository Tests**: 11 test functions for data persistence
- **Service Tests**: 13 test functions for business workflows
- **gRPC Tests**: 8 test functions for API endpoints
- **All tests passing**: 100% success rate

### 6. Development Tools
- **Makefile**: Complete build automation
- **Protocol Buffer Management**: Code generation scripts
- **Docker Support**: Containerization with health checks
- **CLI Client**: Interactive testing and demonstration
- **Development Scripts**: PowerShell automation for Windows

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.24.2
- **API Protocol**: gRPC with Protocol Buffers
- **Testing**: Go standard testing package with table-driven tests
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Build Tools**: Make, PowerShell scripts
- **Schema Management**: Protocol Buffers with Google well-known types

## Extensibility Features
The service is designed for future integrations:

1. **Calendar Integration**: Interface ready for Google Calendar sync
2. **Notification System**: Extensible for email/SMS/push notifications
3. **Group Assignment**: Service layer supports multi-user extensions
4. **Advanced Scheduling**: Time-based workflow management
5. **Database Integration**: Repository interface ready for persistence

## Performance & Reliability
- **Concurrent Safety**: Thread-safe in-memory repository with mutex protection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error propagation and validation
- **Resource Management**: Graceful shutdown with signal handling
- **Health Monitoring**: Docker health checks and logging
- **Development Workflow**: Fast iteration with automated testing

## Shell Commands for Setup

### Prerequisites Installation
```powershell
# Install Go dependencies
go mod download

# Install Protocol Buffer generators
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```

### Build and Run
```powershell
# Generate protobuf code
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File generate-proto-simple.ps1

# Build server and client
go build -o bin/task-server.exe ./cmd/server
go build -o bin/task-client.exe ./cmd/client

# Run server
./bin/task-server.exe -port 8080 -max-inbox-size 5

# Test with client (in another terminal)
./bin/task-client.exe -cmd add -name "Test Task" -desc "Testing the API"
./bin/task-client.exe -cmd list -stage pending
```

### Docker Deployment
```powershell
# Build and run in Docker
docker build -t task-core:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 task-core:latest
